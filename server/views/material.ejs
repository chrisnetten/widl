<p>WIDL can select, reverse-establish, and inspect any material, for any  manufacturing process, through destructive or NDE techniques. </p>
<p>Besides, obtaining material parameters from test data constitutes a major  obstacle to valid computer-based time-simulations.</p>
<p>WIDL can assist toolshops, manufacturers, or OEMs, characterize their materials  for FEA or CFD. </p>
<p>WIDL can also select parameters for modeling at WIDL, or for patrons'  discretionary use. </p>
<p>Moreover, WIDL can develop special equipment for end-applications, from design, build, trials, data acquisition, and analysis of test results. </p>
<p>So if you have a material question, issue, concern, we urge you to reach out to  WIDL.  This can team with you to understand, quantify, and model materials, with  full documentation for reproducibility and future use.  You can 	reach us by email or visit us at 1232-62 McDougall Street, Windsor, ON N8X 3M7 to explore avenues for a mutually beneficial relationships.</p>
